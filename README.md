# Welcome & Hello!

(My GitHub page is still a **work in progress** while I learn more about Git and the many things it can do!)

The most recent project that is close to finished is using machine learning to predict the movement/direction of stock prices (whether the stock price will increase or decrease). <br>
The machine learning models work even under the coronavirus pandemic. However, since the project is not finished, a summary and sample of the project is provided: <br>

For the next project, I hope to be able to predict viral evolution (genetic drift) that can create viable and pathogenic viruses, as well as unviable viruses and determine the reason as to why the evolution is unviable.
