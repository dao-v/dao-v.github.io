# Welcome & Hello!

(My GitHub page is still a **work in progress** while I learn more about Git and the many things it can do!)

The most recent [project](https://github.com/dao-v/Stock_Predictions) that is being worked on involves using machine learning to predict the movement/direction of stock prices for the next day (whether the stock price will increase or decrease). <br>
The machine learning models did worked at the start of the coronavirus pandemic (late Feb. to early Mar.). However, as the pandemic continues to effect the economy, the models were not able to perform as well. <br><br>


For the next project, I hope to be able to predict viral evolution (genetic drift) that can create viable and/or pathogenic viruses, as well as unviable viruses and determine the reason as to why the evolution is favorable or unfavorable.
