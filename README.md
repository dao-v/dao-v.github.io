# Welcome & Hello!

The most recent large [project](https://github.com/dao-v/Vocal_Replacement_of_Audio_Recordings) attempted to replace the vocals of an audio file with the vocals of a specific speaker. The results did not produce the expected outcome. However, the learning process and approach used in this project does serve as the starting point for new and better ideas on how to perform the task. <br><br>

My first large [project](https://github.com/dao-v/Stock_Predictions) involved using random forest to predict the movement/direction of stock prices for the next day (whether the stock price will increase or decrease). <br>
The machine learning models did worked at the start of the coronavirus pandemic (late Feb. to early Mar.). However, as the pandemic continues to effect the economy, the models were not able to perform as well. <br><br>

[Another smaller project examined user information to predict which users are likely to be high usage customers.](https://github.com/dao-v/Predicting_High_Usage_Customers)<br><br>
